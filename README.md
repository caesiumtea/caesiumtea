## hey what's up âœ¨
i'm vance and my pronouns are they/them/their  

i love meeting other devs, learning from each other, and cheering each other on! feel free to say hello anytime c:

i started #100DaysOfCode on 8/24/22! check out my [progress log in Notion](https://caesiumtea.notion.site/100DaysOfCode-4583cd6596e2416599418884cddc1911) (or just follow my daily progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caesiumtea_dev))

#### currently learning (as of Sep 2022)
- working through [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Dev certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) with [Class Central bootcamp](https://www.classcentral.com/cohorts/webdev-bootcamp-fall-2022)
- taking [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

#### want to learn next
- Javascript: you can see my first clumsy experiments with it in my [Ludum Dare 50 repo](https://github.com/caesiumtea/ludum-dare-50). planning to do freeCodeCamp's JS certification after i finish Responsive Web Dev.
- read Automate the Boring Stuff With Python and make myself some practical tools

#### long term goals
- machine learning. i've got a *long* way to go, but my biggest CS goal is to learn how to build neural networks and use them to make weird art.
- fullstack web dev, because i just want to be able to make things and put them out into the world (and be able to help my friends/local nonprofits/etc put themselves out there)
