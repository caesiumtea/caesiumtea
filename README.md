## hey what's up ‚ú®
i'm vance and my pronouns are they/them/their  

i love meeting other devs, learning from each other, and cheering each other on! feel free to say hello anytime c:

#### currently learning (as of January 2024)
- working through [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Dev certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)
- teaching assistant with the [Bad Website Club bootcamp](https://badwebsite.club/)
- brushing up on CSS and JS with [Cod√©dex](http://www.codedex.io/)

#### want to learn next
- read [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and make myself some practical tools
- take [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification

#### long term goals
- machine learning. i've got a *long* way to go, but my biggest CS goal is to learn how to build neural networks and use them to make weird art.
- fullstack web dev, because i just want to be able to make things and put them out into the world (and be able to help my friends/local nonprofits/etc put themselves out there)
- freelance work???
